# How to use the "cloudapps" cli  ![Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/ox42/cloudapps-cli.svg?branch=master)

The cloudapps-cli offers a set of awesome starter kits (boilerplate code) for projects based on Bootstrap, Express, React or Vue.

To get started, make sure you have Node.js installed and type the following command in a Terminal or a Command Prompt:

```
npm install -g cloudapps
```



Afterwards, you can run "cloudapps new" to create a new project from one of our templates:

```
cloudapps new
```

You should set a name for your new project, and choose the template that works best for you. The following templates are currently supported:

* A simple Bootstrap starter page
* A landing page template based on Bootstrap
* Node.js Express app with Gulp, Bootstrap and jQuery
* Node.js Express app with a database and authentication
* A React boilerplate app with Bootstrap and Redux
* A complete React app with Bootstrap, Redux and Authentication
* A Vue.js starter kit with Bootstrap and Vuex
* A complete Vue.js app with Bootstrap, Vuex and Authentication


If you detect any issues with our cli, or any of our templates, don't forget to report it on GitHub.
Good luck!
