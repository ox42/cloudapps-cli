# How to use the "cloudapps" cli  ![Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/ox42/cloudapps-cli.svg?branch=master)

The cloudapps-cli offers a set of awesome starter kits (boilerplate code) for projects based on Bootstrap, Express, React or Vue.

To get started, make sure you have Node.js installed and type the following command in a Terminal or a Command Prompt:

```
npm install -g cloudapps
```



Afterwards, you can run "cloudapps new" to create a new project from one of our templates

```
cloudapps new
```

You should set a name for your new project, and choose the template that works best for you. Good luck
